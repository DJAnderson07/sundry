A sundry of convenience functions

This is a package of functions I use regularly in my applied work. The package is updated as needed (with new convenience functions included or current functions made more flexible). All functions are simple wrappers.

## Install the package
To install the package, run the following code:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools") # Only neccessary if devtools is not already installed
devtools::install_github("DJAnderson07/sundry")
```
